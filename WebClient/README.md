Timecrypt Web Client
====================

General information
-------------------
This directory contains the code used in the Timecrypt demo app. It's the most basic HTML5, JavaScript
and CSS, along with some plugins such as jQuery, Moment.js and others. We also have a Chrome extension
that allows users to quickly forward the current page to Timecrypt, you can check it out
[at this page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timecrypt/mlhobjmkmleepjkigofogldompjgleki).

**This web client is a hacked-up demo. The future of Timecrypt is with
[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/ "Get started").**

You can configure this _(temporary)_ web client implementation to use your server and app URL through
the landing page. Go to `index.html` and look for `<!-- Configuration -->` comment.

Design and usability
--------------------

The design you can see on the Timecrypt page currently is something Mickey came up with, inspired by
some of the best scenes and cameos from the Mission Impossible saga. You can find more of that on his
[Behance channel](https://www.behance.net/gallery/17741037/Cryptextme "Design"), but it may be outdated
because we later changed both the name of the app and the design (but not by much).

License and improvements
------------------------

As long as you use this repository for refactoring and improvements, you are fine. For all bigger changes
you need to open a formal issue on the repository and we can discuss it over there.
